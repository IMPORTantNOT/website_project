    <body>
        <p>I had no idea what this website is going to be used for, since it is a project I need to do. In this specific case I got no inspiration whatsoever.</p>
        <h3>Don't believe me?</h3>
        <p>So you think there must be a purpose to this? Well let me provide reasons to prove you wrong.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I had to do it.</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of time trying to come up with a purpose, yet here we are.</li>
            <li>Another valid reason.</li>
            <li>An even more convincing reason.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Still don't understand?</h3>
        <p>It seems that you have chosen to not leave this website. You are probably expecting something hidden. Some "secret" to uncover, or whatever. Let's pretend that I tried to explain: Here's another list (everyone <b>LOVES</b> lists, right?)</p>
        <ol>
            <li>It's my first time using html.</li>
            <li>Given previous information</li>
            <li>I physically couldn't do anything higher the bare minimum.</li>
            <li>See my point?</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Now you're just scrolling out of interest, right?</h3>
        <p>Well if it isn't one of the human's core qualities: To be stubborn and do as youre told not to. Perchaps, lists are <b>TOO BORING</b> for you to read? I can understand that.</p>
        <h3>Which is why I will add a table that's DEFINITELY not there to fulfill the requirement of the project.</h3>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>No</th>
    <th>inspiration</th>
    <th>whatsoever.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Actually</td>
    <td>its</td>
    <td>even worse.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I thought</td>
    <td>I had no inspiration</td>
    <td>to begin with.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Now here, for the sake of saving time, I will add picture before you even ask for it (which you obviously won't do).</p>
<embed src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.JT5CnQKh4qPINKkqnaV7EQAAAA?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain">
<p>P.S. Oh you thought I would add some meaning to this? Nope. It's just nothing, so you can't consider it to be something (obviously).</p>
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ>Anyways here's a link for this picture that you will never need.</a>
<p>Lastly, let me provide you some video evidence at last.</p>
